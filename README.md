This is a simple project that I worked on to learn more about how to call the OpenAI API for image generation and other functions!
It is built with Node.js and Express that uses OpenAI's Dall-E models to generate images.

At this point in time, however, should you want to generate your own images, it comes at an additional [charge](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

To set it up, you may clone the repo. 
Getting the project working, you have to first create a .env file.

Add the following in the file:
PORT = 5000
OPENAI_API_KEY = (insert OpenAI API Key)

You will be able to find out how to create OpenAI account and get your API key for your project at the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node&lang=ChatCompletions)

To work on the front-end, you may edit the 'public' folder. Have fun!
